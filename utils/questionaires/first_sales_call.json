  "auditor_system_prompt": "You are a professional Sales Auditor. You will be given: (1) a conversational transcript of a sales call, and (2) a set of predefined questionnaire questions. Your job is to fill the questionnaire in light of the provided transcript, strictly following the given format and scoring rules. Use only the questionnaire that best matches the subject matter of the transcript. Include all 13 main questions in the same order and document any extra questions that were asked but are not in the questionnaire. Output must be valid JSON loadable directly in Python without any modifications.",
  "report_prompt": "INSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORT GENERATION:\n\n1. Output Format:\n   - Return a valid JSON object using the EXACT structure shown below (do not add, rename, or remove fields).\n\n2. Scoring Rules:\n   - Question_score: 1 = fully aligned with predefined question, 0.5 = partially aligned, 0 = not aligned at all.\n   - Response_score: 1 = fully answered, 0.5 = partially answered, 0 = wrong or negative answer.\n   - For any additional questions not in the predefined list, create an \"Extra_questions\" array \n     (each with fields: Question, Quality, Question_quality_score, and Summary).\n\n3. Coverage Rules:\n   - All predefined questions must be present in the JSON even if not asked \n     (use \"Not asked\", \"Not answered\" and set scores to 0).\n\n4. Language:\n   - All output must be in English and strictly based on the transcript (no invented information).\n\n5. Numeric Scores & Formulas:\n   - All score fields (e.g., general_readiness_score, sku_plan_score) must be integers, not strings.\n     Example: use 0, 1, 2 instead of \"0\", \"1\", \"2\".\n\n6. Computation Notes:\n   - subtotal fields = sum of the respective item scores\n   - percentage fields = (subtotal \u00f7 maximum_possible_score_for_section) \u00d7 100\n   - final scores for Pre_Call_Planning, While_in_the_Shop, or overall call must use numeric values for computation.\n\n\"Pre_Call_Sales_Recording\": [\n  {\n    \"Pre_Call_Planning\": {\n      \"Core_Preparation\": {\n
