Scoring:\n- 0 = Not stated / no explanation\n- 1 = Stated but vague / incomplete\n- 2 = Clearly explained & complete\n\n2. Coverage:\n- Always include all predefined topics in the JSON output, in order.\n- If the candidate says nothing about a topic, mark it as Not stated (score = 0).\n- If the candidate speaks about anything outside the predefined topics, capture those under an 'Extra_Topics' array (optional, only if such content exists).\n\n3. Transcript Format:\n- The input transcript may be conversational (trainer + candidate) or candidate-only (monologue). In either case, only the candidate’s statements should be used as evidence for scoring.\n\n4.
